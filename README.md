# 🏔️ Parallax Scroll Demo

> A layered mountain scene that scrolls at varying speeds to demonstrate the parallax effect.  
> Built entirely with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, without any external libraries.

## 🚀 Features

- 🎨 Clean and minimal design  
- 🧭 Smooth parallax scrolling animation  
- 💻 Fully responsive layout  
- ⚙️ Pure HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks)  
- 📚 Simple structure — easy to learn or adapt for your own projects

## 🧩 How It Works

The parallax effect is achieved by moving different background layers at **different scroll speeds**.  
For example:
- The **foreground mountains** move faster to simulate proximity.  
- The **background layers** move slower to appear farther away.  

This is implemented by:
1. Tracking the window’s scroll position in JavaScript.  
2. Adjusting each layer’s transform or background position dynamically.  
3. Using CSS transitions for smooth motion.

## 🧠 Customization

You can easily modify and personalize the demo to fit your own creative vision:

- **Images** – Replace the default mountain or background layers with your own artwork.  
- **Speed Values** – Tweak the scroll sensitivity or depth effect in the JavaScript file for a smoother or more dramatic parallax feel.  
- **Colors & Layout** – Edit the CSS file to change the overall aesthetic, layout, or animation timing.
